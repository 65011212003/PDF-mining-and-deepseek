rice blast, bacterial blight.Summary
Rice blast and bacterial blight represent two of major diseases having devastating impact on the
yield of rice in most rice-growing countries. Developments of resistant cultivars are the most
economic and effective strategy to control these diseases. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
gene editing to rapidly install mutations in three known broad-spectrum blast-resistant genes,
Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 andERF922 ,i na n indica thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) rice line
Longke638S (LK638S). We obtained transgene-free homozygous single or triple mutants in T 1
generations. While all single and triple mutants showed increased resistance to rice blast
compared with wild type, the erf922 mutants displayed the strongest blast resistance similar with
triple mutants. Surprisingly, we found that Pi21 orERF922 single mutants conferred enhanced
resistance to most of tested bacterial blight. Both resistances in mutants were attribute to the up-
regulation of SA- and JA-pathway associated genes. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of these
single mutants in paddy ﬁelds revealed that there were no trade-offs between resistances and
main agricultural traits. Together, our study provides a rapid and effective way to generate rice
varieties with resistance to both rice blast and bacterial blight.
Introduction
Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important staple foods
feeding more than 50% population worldwide. However, its
production and quality are severely threatened by a variety of
pathogens. Among them, Magnaporthe oryzae (M.oryzae ) and
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) are two well-known
destructive pathogens causing rice blast and bacterial blight,
respectively (Yin et al., 2018). The most economic and effective
approach to control these diseases is to create the rice cultivars
with broad-spectrum resistance against both of them (Deng et al.,
2017).
Hybrid rice with high yield plays a vital role in guarantee for
staple food supply worldwide (Cheng et al ., 2007). Compared
with conventional three-line hybrid rice, the two-line hybrid rice
has attracted increasing attention as it is independent of restorer
genes and more efﬁcient in production of hybrid seeds (Yuan,
1994). Thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) and
photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility (PGMS) lines are the
central component for the two-line hybrid approach. LK638S is
anindica (Xian) TGMS line developed in the 2000s with low
critical sterility-inducing temperature ( <23.5/C176C), high outcrossing
rate, good combining ability, but susceptible to rice blast and
bacterial blight. Thus, establishing its variants with multiple
diseases resistance is of great importance.
Plants have evolved a two-layered innate immune system to
defend against pathogens (Zhao et al ., 2018). The ﬁrst layer isactivated upon perception of pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) by cell surface pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs), leading to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). The ﬁrst layer
could be overcome by pathogens through secreting PTI-inhibited
effectors into plant cells, which activate effector-triggered
susceptibility (ETS). To respond this virulence strategy, the second
layer was activated by expressing plant resistance ( R) genes,
which speciﬁcally recognize pathogen effectors to activate
effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (Dangl et al ., 2013). These
innate immune responses trigger many molecular events, includ-
ing induction of a large number of defense-responsive genes
(Eulgem and Somssich 2007), production of defense signal
molecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Kaku et al ., 2006)
and phytohormones (De Vleesschauwer et al., 2013). Salicylic acid
(SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) represent two most important
phytohormones in regulation of plant immune responses (Liu
et al., 2016). Resistance to biotrophic pathogens is predominantly
involved in SA-dependent pathway, whereas resistance to
necrotrophic pathogens and insects is usually associated with
JA- and ET-driven defenses (De Vleesschauwer et al., 2013), e.g.,
overexpression of OsWRKY13 , a WRKY-type transcription factor,
enhanced rice resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight, which
was associated with the activation of SA synthesis- and responsive
genes (Qiu et al., 2007); knock-outs of MPK15 enhanced disease
resistance in rice against blast and bacterial blight accompanied
by up-regulation of SA- and JA-pathway-associated genes (Hong
et al., 2019).

Recently, more than 100 major rice blast Rgenes have been
identiﬁed and 37 of them have been cloned and characterized(Yin et al., 2021). Except for Pid2,pi21 and Ptr, most known R
genes encode typical nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich
repeat containing (NLR) domain, which directly or indirectly
interact with fungal effectors to trigger ETI (Dangl et al., 2013;
Yinet al., 2021). The comprehensive understanding of immunity
mechanisms of Rgenes can enhance the rice breeding with
durable resistance. So far, an atypical Rgene Pi21 and two
defense-related genes Bsr-d1 as well as ERF922 have attracted
much more attention due to their broad-spectrum resistance. Bsr-
d1encodes a C
2H2-type transcription factor that directly binds to
the promoter of three peroxidase genes ( Os01g73170 ,
Os05g04470 and Os10g39170 ), thereby affecting H 2O2accu-
mulation and broad-spectrum resistance to M.oryzae (Liet al.,
2017; Tao et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020). In addition, Bsr-d1 was
shown to be transcriptionally regulated by MYSB1 through
directly binding to its promoter and a single base change
(SNP33-G) in the Bsr-d1 promoter leads to enhanced afﬁnity
with MYSB1, which suppresses Bsr-d1 gene expression. Pi21
encodes a proline-rich protein containing a putative heavy metal-
binding domain and protein –protein interaction motifs (Fukuoka
et al., 2009). Deletions of the proline-rich motifs cause a loss of
function. Knockout of Pi21 confers non-race speciﬁc and durable
blast resistance (Tao et al., 2021). ERF922 encodes an APETELA2/
ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) type transcription factor and is
strongly induced by M.oryzae (Liuet al., 2012). Knockdown or
knockout of ERF922 resulted in enhanced resistance against rice
blast, indicating the negative regulation role of this gene indisease resistance. To date, all the studies regarding Bsr-d1 ,Pi21
and ERF922 only separately explored their roles in resistance
against rice blast and were mainly carried out in the japonica rice
background. The rice blast resistance comparison of these three
genes under the same rice variety as well as their roles in
resistance to bacterial blight remains unknown.
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology enables targeted
mutagenesis of DNA (Baltes and Voytas,2015). Due to its
simplicity, feasibility and versatility, it has been increasinglyemployed in a variety of organisms including crops that wereedited for trait improvements. Moreover, because of its ability for
multiplexable genome targeting, it could be used to improve
multiple traits simultaneously (Oliva et al ., 2019; Tang et al .,
2017; Wang et al ., 2016; Xu et al ., 2019; Zhang et al ., 2018;
Zhou et al., 2016).
In this study, we have set an example of CRISPR/Cas9
applications in enhancing multiple disease resistance in a com-
mercial indica TGMS line LK638S. We chose three broad-
spectrum blast-resistant genes ( Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 and ERF922 ) and
created their single as well as triple mutants. We found that
ERF922 mutants showed the strongest blast resistance level
similar with triple mutants. Furthermore, we also explored theirnew roles in resistance to bacterial blight. Our study indicatesCRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful tool in modern molecular breeding by
targeted genes modiﬁcations that could signiﬁcantly accelerate
the breeding of rice varieties with multiple disease resistance.
Results
Targeted mutagenesis of Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 and ERF922 genes
To generate Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 and ERF922 single mutants, three
sgRNAs were designed (Figure 1a-c). An expression vector thatcontained the Cas9 cassette driven by the ubiquitin promoter andsingle guide RNA (sgRNA) scaffold under the rice small nuclear
RNA promoters was constructed based on previously describedCRISPR/Cas9 vector (Yin et al., 2018). We took advantage of this
vector to target one or multiple sites via a single construct, to
create bsr-d1 -o r pi21-o r erf922 -targeted single gene mutants
and triple bsr-d1/pi21/erf922 mutants (Figure 1d, e). These
recombinant expression vectors were used to transform the
TGMS variety Longke638S (LK638S) via Agrobacterium -mediated
transformation. Based on hygromycin-resistant selection, weobtained 34 resistant lines for bsr-d1 , 22 for pi21, 45 for
erf922 as well as 35 for triple bsr-d1/pi21/erf922 . The PCR-based
sanger sequencing was performed to produce about 82% (28/34), 68% (15/22), 73% (33/45) and 71% (25/35) targeting
efﬁciency for Bsr-d1 ,Pi21,ERF922 and triple Bsr-d1/Pi21/ERF922
genes, respectively (Table 1). Seven, ﬁve, eight homozygoussingle mutants for Bsr-d1 ,Pi21,ERF922 , respectively, as well as
three homozygous triple mutants were identiﬁed in the T
0
generations (Figure S1), but unfortunately no double-mutantplants were detected. In the T
1generation, for each gene, we
obtained two transgene-free mutants harbouring frameshift
mutations (Figure 1f, g and Figure S2), and the reverse transcrip-
tion quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the expression ofBsr-d1 ,Pi21,ERF922 were reduced in single or triple mutants
(Figure S3), which could be explained by cellular nonsense-
mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mechanism as described previously(Lykke-Andersen and Jensen 2015). These results indicated that
both protein and transcriptional abundance were affected in
these single and triple mutants.
Rice blast resistance was enhanced in mutants
To investigate their ability against rice blast, bsr-d1, pi21 and
erf922 mutants were evaluated for leaf blast resistance at
seedling stages in the blast nursery of Dawei Mountain. The
results showed that the LK638S leaves had much more lesionsthat were signiﬁcantly decreased in all single and triple mutant
lines (Figure 2a, b and Figure S4). To conﬁrm these lesions were
caused by M.oryzae , the amount of M.oryzae present in each
inoculated leaf was measured by quantifying fungal-speciﬁc DNA.DNA-based quantitative PCR (q-PCR) showed that the mutant
lines harboured less fungus than that in LK638S (Figure 2c).
Importantly, we observed that the erf922 mutants exhibited the
strongest resistance than the other two single mutants but no
signiﬁcant difference with triple mutants. To determine if ERF922
was transcriptionally regulated by Bsr-d1 andPi21, we carried out
RT-qPCR to analyse the transcriptional abundance of ERF922 in
LK638S, bsr-d1 as well as pi21 (Figure S5). As the result showed,
the expression levels of ERF922 exhibited no signiﬁcant difference
between LK638S and each mutant, consistent with the previous
report (Li et al ., 2017). To test if enhanced blast resistance still
existed at reproductive stage, the blast evaluation on rice panicleswas conducted, and the results showed that percentage ofdiseased panicles in mutants were signiﬁcantly lower than that in
LK638S (Figure S6). These results demonstrated that the loss
function of Bsr-d1, Pi21 orERF922 improved the blast resistance
at both seedling and reproductive stages. To further evaluate the
rice blast resistance of the mutants in greenhouse, two blast
isolates collected from different regions of China were used (110-2 and E2007046A2 from Hunan and Hubei, respectively). All
mutant lines exhibited increased resistance to rice blast, as
reﬂected by the signiﬁcantly decreased lesion length and fungalbiomass in the mutant lines compared with the LK638S at

10 days’ post-inoculation (dpi) (Figure 3a, b). Notably, the lesion
length and fungal biomass of erf922-1 and bsr-d1pi21erf922-1
were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the bsr-d1-9 and pi21-1
(Figure 3a, b). All together, these results suggested that knockoutofBsr-d1, Pi21 orERF922 enhanced rice blast resistance in the
background of LK638S, and among them, erf922 conferred the
strongest resistance.
The expression analysis of defense-related
genes in mutants
Rice Bsr-d1 suppresses the expression of peroxidase genes
through binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor
(MYBS1) to the bsr-d1 promoter, resulting in broad-spectrum
resistance to rice blast (Li et al ., 2017; Zhu et al ., 2020). Thus,
three Bsr-d1 target peroxidase genes ( LOC_Os01g73170 ,
LOC_Os05g04470 and LOC_Os10g39170 ) were used fordetermining the expression level by RT-qPCR. The results showed
that these peroxidase genes in the bsr-d1 mutant lines were
reduced by 2- to 12-fold in comparison with wild-type LK638S,
consistent with the previous study (Li et al., 2017) (Figure S7a-c).
The content of H 2O2in the bsr-d1 mutant lines was signiﬁcantly
higher than that in LK638S (Figure S7d). These results indicated
that loss function of Bsr-d1 reduced the expression of the
peroxidase genes and increased the amount of H 2O2, thereby
leading to the resistance to a broad spectrum of rice blast.
Activation of plant immune responses during pathogen attack
is accompanied by defense hormone pathways, including the SAsignalling pathway marker gene OsPR1a (Agrawal et al., 2000),
OsPR1b (Agrawal et al., 2001), OsWRKY45 (Tao et al., 2009), and
jasmonate acid (JA) signalling pathway marker gene OsPR4
(Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, the expressions of these defense-
related genes were analysed in the mutant lines and LK638S at
0 h and 24 h after the leaves were inoculated with rice blast. The
expression levels of these defense-related genes were markedlyhigher in mutant lines than those in LK638S at 24 h post-
inoculation (hpi) (Figure 4). These results indicated that knockouts
ofBsr-d1 orPi21 orERF922 activated the SA and JA signalling
pathway genes by rice blast fungi, which may have contributed totheir improvement of rice blast resistance.
Knockout of Pi21 orERF922 conferred robust
resistance to bacterial blight
SA and JA are the most important plant hormones that play major
roles in regulation of plant defense responses against Xoo (Bari

and Jones 2009; De Vleesschauwer et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2019;
Qiuet al., 2007). To investigate the bacterial blight resistance of
the mutant lines, we inoculated 6 Xoo strains (Table S2) to
mutant lines using the tip-cutting method (Ji et al., 2016). When
the mutant lines were inoculated with FuJ, PXO61 and PXO71,respectively, the pi21-1 anderf922-1 showed signiﬁcantly shorter
lesions length than LK638S (Figure 5a, b). The lengths of the
lesions on erf922-1 andpi21-1 caused by the PXO86 and PXO99
were signiﬁcantly shorter than those observed in LK638S,
respectively. Additionally, upon artiﬁcial inoculation of YN24,
there were no signiﬁcant difference of lesions length weredetected between mutant lines and LK638S. These resultsdemonstrated that knockout of Pi21 orERF922 in LK638S
background can improve resistance against bacterial blight
disease. To further elucidate the regulation network, thetranscriptional levels of SA and JA signalling pathway genes were
examined by RT-qPCR. The results showed that all the tested
genes were signiﬁcantly up-regulated in pi21-1 and erf922-1
when the mutant plants inoculated with Xoo, whereas these
genes remained unchanged in bsr-d1-9 , except for OsWRKY45 ,
which was induced in bsr-d1-9 (Figure S8). These results suggest
that the knockout of Pi21 orERF922 in LK638S-enhanced
resistance to bacterial blight disease, which may result from the
activation of the SA and JA signalling pathway genes.
Characterizations of main agronomic traits in
mutants
The above results showed that bsr-d1-9 ,pi21-1 ,erf922-1 and
bsr-d1pi21erf922-1 mutants were more resistant to rice blast
(Figure 2, 3), and the pi21-1 and erf922-1 mutants showed
increased resistance to bacterial blight (Figure 5). We further
investigated whether increased resistances against rice blast and
bacterial blight could affect rice growth. At the mature stage,main agronomic traits including plant height, tillers per plant,panicle length and grain number per panicle were measured.
Compared with that in wild-type LK638S, the plant height and
tiller number in triple mutant bsr-d1pi21erf922-1 were signiﬁ-
cantly lower, while there were not signiﬁcantly different in thesingle mutant bsr-d1-9 ,pi21-1 orerf922-1 (Figure 6). In addition,
there were no signiﬁcant difference for the panicle length andgrain number between all mutant lines and LK638S. These results
suggested that knockouts of Pi21 orERF922 exhibited increased
resistance against both rice blast and bacterial blight withoutcompromising major agricultural traits.
Discussion
Currently, the objective for rice breeding is diversiﬁed, andbreeders consider not only high yields but also rice quality anddisease resistance. Rice blast and bacterial blight are primarydestructive diseases that badly affect not only rice production but
also rice quality. In the current study, we took advantage of
CRISPR/Cas9 technology to edit three known broad-spectrumblast resistant genes Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 as well as ERF922 in a very high
efﬁciency to generate each single and triple mutant in T
0
generations (Table 1). We further carried out inoculation exper-
iments and proved that all the single and triple mutants conferred
enhanced resistance to rice blast (Figure 2 and 3). It is worth
noting that the erf922 mutants exhibited the strongest blast
resistance among all single mutants similar with bsd-
d1pi21erf922 triple mutants indicating that ERF922 is preferred
to being employed to increase the blast resistance under the
background of LK638S. In addition, similar blast resistances inerf922 andbsd-d1pi21erf922 triple mutants suggested possibility
that ERF922 may act downstream of Bsd-d1 and Pi21. ERF922
may integrate Bsd-d1- and Pi21-mediated resistant signalling torespond pathogen attack. Expression levels of ERF922 exhibited
no signiﬁcant difference between WT and each single mutant
(Figure S5), suggesting the possibility that ERF922 was post-
transcriptionally regulated. The detailed post-transcriptional
mechanism will be the subject of future work. Previously, all
the studies regarding Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 andERF922 only explored their
roles in resistance against rice blast. It was unknown whetherthese three genes played roles in resistance to bacterial blight. In
the present study, by testing six typical Xoo strains, we showed
that pi21-1 and erf922-1 mutants exhibited resistances to four
out of six Xoo strains with one Chinese isolates (FuJ) and three

Philippine strains (PXO61, PXO71, PXO99 or PXO86) (Figure 5).
More Xoo strains will be tested in these mutants to investigate
their broad-spectrum resistance to the bacterial blight. A recentstudy showed that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiplex editing of
thePi21,Bsr-d1 as well as a well-known Xoo-resistant gene Xa5
generated pi21-bsr-d1-xa5 triple mutant which conferred resis-
tant to both blast and bacterial blight (Tao et al., 2021). In our
study, on one hand, we further compared the blast resistance
level among Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 and ERF922 single mutants and
identiﬁed the erf922 mutant with the strongest blast resistance.
On the other hand, our study described the new roles of Pi21 as
well as ERF922 in the resistance to Xoo, which could well explain
why the pi21-bsr-d1-xa5 triple mutant exhibited much stronger
resistance to Xoo than xa5single mutant in the previous study
(Tao et al., 2021).
It has been reported that many plant pathogenic Xanthomonas
spp. secreted a class of proteins designated transcription activator-
like (TAL) effectors that were injected into plant cells via the type III
secretion system (TTSS) to activate the expression of host suscep-tibility genes that result in diseases (Hu et al ., 2014; Xu et al .,2019). TALEs activate the expression of host gene through binding
into speciﬁc promoters of host target genes (Wang et al., 2015).
For example, the Os8N3 was activated by the TAL effector PthXo1
from Xoo strain PXO99 by recognition of TAL effector binding
elements (EBEs) located at the promoter region of Os8N3 (Romer
et al., 2010). Likewise, based on the enhanced resistances to Xoo
strains in pi21 and erf922 mutants, we speculated that TALEs
secreted by these Xoo strains might target the promoter region of
Pi21 and ERF922 to activate Pi21 and ERF922 expressions and
hence causing diseases, whereas the loss function of Pi21 or
ERF922 was conducive to the bacterial blight resistances.
Plants response to pathogen attack by a combination of
constitutive and inducible defense responses. Many of theseresponses are modulated through complex interconnecting signal
transduction pathways, within which hormones fulﬁll central
roles (De Vleesschauwer et al., 2013). Plant immunity is usually
associated with SA and JA hormone signalling pathways (Bari and
Jones 2009). For example, knockdown of OsBON1 conferred
enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens,which was accompanied by the activation of SA- and JA-

marker gene OsWRKY45 from indica rice varieties positively
regulates rice resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight (Tao
et al., 2009). The expression of OsWRKY45 was induced not only
byM.grisea but also Xoo (Ryu et al ., 2006; Tao et al ., 2009).
OsWRKY45- overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance
to rice blast and bacterial blight. In this study, upon plants were
infected with the rice blast, higher levels of SA signalling related
genes OsPR1a ,OsPR1b ,OsWRKY45 and JA signalling pathway
gene OsPR4 were detected in mutants than that in wild-type
plants (Figure 4). In addition, when the mutant plants were
inoculated with bacterial blight, the OsPR1a ,OsPR1b ,OsWRKY45
and OsPR4 were signiﬁcantly up-regulated in pi21-1 anderf922-1
(Figure S8). These results indicated that the enhancement of
resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight may be associated withthe activation of SA and JA signalling genes in mutants. However,
detailed molecular mechanisms of Pi21- and ERF922 -mediated
immunity to bacterial blight still require further study. Of note,the inconsistence of gene expression in Figure 4 and Figure S8 at0 h (e.g. expression of OsWRKY45 is slightly higher in each
mutant than LK638S in Figure 4 but similar in Figure S8) could be
explained by the fact that the samples used for mRNA detectionin the two experiments were different in terms of developmental
stage, growth environment as well as the sampling area.
Together, our work provides a convenient, rapid and effectiveway to obtain rice cultivars against the blast as well as bacterialblight by CRISPR/Cas9, which could signiﬁcantly accelerate the
breeding of rice varieties with multiple disease resistance.
Experimental procedures
Construct and rice transformation
The target sites of Bsr-d1 ,Pi21 andERF922 were selected by the
CRISPR-Plant Web server (Xie et al., 2014) and were constructed
into the CRISPR/Cas9 vector as described previously (Ma et al .,
2015). Brieﬂy, the designed targeting sequence was synthesized
and annealed to form the oligo adaptors. The oligo adaptors were
inserted into the sgRNA expression cassette vectors at a Eco31 I
site. The integrated sgRNA expression cassette was then ampliﬁed
by PCR using universal primers, and the amplicons were cloned
into the CRISPR/Cas9 plant expression vector. The CRISPR/Cas9plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
EHA105. Rice transformation of LK638S was performed as
described previously (Zhou et al ., 2018). Speciﬁc primer pairs
Cas9-F/Cas9-R and HPT-F/HPT-R were used to conﬁrm T
0
transgenic-positive plants. Bsr-d1-CX-F/Bsr-d1-CX-R, Pi21-CX-F/Pi21-CX-R and ERF922-CX-F/ERF922-CX-R were used to amplifythe genome regions containing each target site, and the resultingPCR products were followed by sequencing to detect mutations
in T
0and T 1generations. Sequencing results were decoded by an
online tool DSDecodeM (http://skl.scau.edu.cn/ dsdecode/) (Liuet al ., 2015b). Transgene-free plants were identiﬁed using the
primer pairs Cas9-F/Cas9-R and HPT-F/HPT-R and determined by
both showing negative ampliﬁcation. Sequences of the primersare listed in Table S1.

Rice blast Inoculation
The rice blast nursery investigation was performed during April to
May in two consecutive years (2019-2020) in Dawei Mountain
(Hunan Province, 28 °490N, 113 °990E). Fifty seeds of LK638S andmutant rice plants were sown in single-row plots, and three
extremely susceptible cultivars 9311, Xiangaizao7 and Xiang-
wanxian11 were sown on the plot borders used as an inducer toensure uniform blast infection. The diseased straws were cut into
small segments (2-3 cm) and sprinkled over the susceptible

spreader cultivars at the two-leaf stage to induce natural
infection. Twenty-ﬁve days later, ﬂag leaves were harvested to
analyse lesion area and relative fungal biomass. The relativefungal biomass was calculated using the threshold cycle value (C
t)
ofM.oryza ePot2 gene against the C tof the rice genomic
ubiquitin ( OsUbi ) gene (Li et al., 2017). Sequences of the primers
are listed in Table S1.
Punch inoculation was performed as previously described (Liu
et al ., 2015a) with slight modiﬁcation. Detached leaf sheaths
from the fourth leaf of ﬁve-leaf-stage seedlings were inoculatedwith two M.oryzae isolates collected from different regions of
China, with 110-2 strain from Hunan and E2007046A2 from
Hubei. M.oryzae isolates were grown on complete agar medium
for 15 d before producing spores. Spores were collected via
ﬂooding of the fungal agar cultures with sterile water, and the
spore concentration in the suspension was adjusted to 5 910
5
conidia/mL before punch inoculation. Dip 5 lL spore suspension
for each drop using pipette tip at two spots on each leaf.
Inoculated detached leaves were placed in 0.1% 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) in sterile water to keep moist. Thelesion lengths of disease reactions were measured at 10 days’
post-inoculation (dpi). Relative fungal biomass was calculated
using the threshold cycle value (Ct) of M.oryzae Pot2 gene
against the Ct of the rice genomic ubiquitin ( OsUbi ) gene (Li et al.,
2017).
Blast resistance at productive stage was also investigated in an
experimental paddy ﬁeld in Dawei Mountain. Twenty-four plants
were transplanted for each line in early June. After ﬂowering, the
blast symptoms in rice neck were evaluated. The total number ofpanicles and the number of diseased panicles (with at least one
black neck symptom) were counted for each plant. The panicle
severity of a plot was deﬁned as the mean of percentage ofdiseased panicle from 20 plants (Sester et al., 2014). Percentageof diseased panicle =% (the number of diseased panicles/ total
number of panicles).
Bacteria strains and inoculation
To examine resistance of bacterial blight, Xoo strains were grown
in TSA medium (10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L sucrose, 1 g/L glutamic
acid, 15 g/L agar and PH 6.8-7.0). Bacteria were suspended in
sterile water to an OD 600=1.0 for inoculation on rice leaves. Rice
plants at the booting stage were inoculated with the leaf-clippingmethod as previously described (Xu et al ., 2019). Disease
phenotype was scored by measuring the lesion length at 2 weeks
after inoculation. The sources of the Xoo strains tested in this
study are listed in Table S2.
RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA isolation and reverse transcription quantitative PCR(RT-qPCR) were carried out as described previously (Zhou et al.,
2015). To analyse the inﬂuence of M.oryzae infection on gene
expression, three-week-old rice plants growing in the chamber
were sprayed with 110-2 spores. The inoculated plants were kept
in the growth chamber for 24 h in the dark at 25 °C with 90%
relative humidity. The inoculation leaves were harvested to
analyse the gene expression. To examine the inﬂuence of
bacterial blight infection on gene expression, ﬂag leaves from2-month-old rice plants in the paddy ﬁeld were used. About 3 cm
leaf fragments next to Xoo strain FuJ infection sites were used for
RNA isolation. The primers used for RT-qPCR are listed inTable S1. The expression of rice Actin gene (LOC_Os03g50885)
was used as an internal control. The relative expression levels
were measured as previously described (Livak and Schmittgen2001).

H2O2accumulation
The concentration of H 2O2was measured according to the
method described previously (Zhou et al., 2018).
Characterization of agronomic trait
The wild-type LK638S and each mutant were planted with three
replications in paddy ﬁelds located at Guanshan village(28°19’32’’N, 112 °40’38’’E), Changsha, in 2020. Each plot
consisted of 7 rows with 8 plants per row at a planting density
of 20 cm 920 cm, and the ﬁeld management was the same as
that used in local paddy ﬁelds. Upon harvest, 20 plants in the
middle of each plot were randomly selected for investigations of
main agronomic traits, including plant height, tillers per plant,panicle length and grain number per panicle. Statistical analysesof these data were performed using Student’s t test.

(b),erf922 (c) and triple mutants bsr-d1pi21erf922 (d).
Figure S5 Transcriptional abundance of ERF922 inbsr-d1 ,pi21
andLK638S . Data are presented as mean /C6SD (n =3).
Figure S6 Evaluation of panicle blast resistance at natural
nurseries. Percentage of diseased panicle =% (the number of
diseased panicles/total number of panicles). Data are presented asmean /C6SD (n =20,**P<0.01, Student’s t-test ).
Figure S7 Transcriptional abundance of the peroxidase genes by
RT-qPCR in Bsr-d1 knockout plants. (a-c) mRNA levels of the
Os05g04470 (a),Os10g39170 (b) and Os01g73170
(c) genes in
LK638S and bsr-d1 mutant lines under normal growth condition
by RT-qPCR. (d) H 2O2content in LK638S and bsr-d1 mutant lines
under normal growth condition. Data are presented as mean /C6
SD (n =3,**P=0.01, Student’s t-test ).
Figure S8 Transcriptional abundances of SA- and JA-regulated
defense-related genes in mutant lines. (a-d) Expression levels ofthe genes involved in SA (a-c) and JA (d) signal transduction in
LK638S, bsr-d1-9 ,pi21-1 anderf922-1 were determined at 0h as
well as 72h after FuJ infection by RT-qPCR. Data are presented asmean /C6SD (n =3,*P=0.05; **P=0.01, Student’s t-test ).
